Using createdb Command

PostgreSQL command line executable createdb is a wrapper around the SQL command CREATE DATABASE. The only difference between this command and SQL command CREATE DATABASE is that the former can be directly run from the command line and it allows a comment to be added into the database, all in one command.
Syntax

The syntax for createdb is as shown below −
createdb [option...] [dbname [description]]



createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres testdb
password
